The basic idea for task 1 is that the social media evolution data and backer network data have most relevant information. 
For backer network we create a 1829 x 1829 weighted graph indicating similarity between projects by simply taking product of G G'  where G is the backer network matrix represented in sparse format. That is it is the (1829, 146983197) matrix. This gives us the weighted graph between projects. We next extract features from this graph by computing spectral embedding (to 1200 dimensions) This gives us a feature matrix for graph. Now we perform CCA of this matrix with the social evolution matrix to one dimension. Now thresholding this results in a labeling. Finally we simply use the weak supervision to identify the right class. 

The key hurdle in this problem is that while one can get better than random guess accuracy, the classes dont seperate as 2 neat clusters (or even more). The choice of using ~ 1200  or more generally large K for spectral embedding is crucial as information is fairly spread around.
